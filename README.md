## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently wokring on a free local [app for transcoding videos to `.mp4`](https://github.com/dendotai/transvibe-app)
- I made a goal not to look at code as much as possible in this project to explore the limits of âœ¨vibe codingâœ¨
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning local-first, offline-first and sync engines.
